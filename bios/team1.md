Nicole Gountanis: I am a rising senior in the Astro department interested in galaxies, galaxy formation, large scale structure, and cosmology. I plan to attend grad school for these topics after Princeton. I was born and raised in Chicago. Outside of school, I compete for Princeton Taekwondo and powerlift.
